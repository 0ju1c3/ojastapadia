I love watching videos of [NetworkChuck][1] and recently he published a [video][2] and I WAS HOOKED!
In the video, he references **Building a Second Brain by Tiago Forte**, and I have been reading it since then, and I love it!

Making a blog has always been something that I wanted to do, but lacked in skills and insights that I can provide. But after reading, even a few chapters of it, I can't help make a blog or **second brain** of my own. 

Second Brain will be primarily divided into 3 parts:
- **Commonplace** : Consolidation of my myriad marginalia
- **Biji** : Book reviews, quotations and anything I found worth recording
- **Personal** : Reminders to myself and my future self.

About Me
--------
I’m a **founding backend developer** at **[InteractNow][5]** and **[AuraX][6]**, where I’ve had the chance to dive deep into backend architecture, build scalable systems, and tackle complex challenges. I am also **Full Stack Intern** at **[Preternatural AI][7]** and **PRISM Intern** at [Samsung Research Institute-Bangalore][8]**. My journey started with a passion for coding and a knack for solving problems, which led me to these exciting roles.

In addition to my startup work, I’ve been actively involved with VIT’s tech team, where I’ve organized events, judged competitions, and developed the backend for our tech community’s website. 

When I’m not coding for my startups or organizing tech events, you’ll find me experimenting with new projects or cooking up something new. I’m always on the lookout for new tools and techniques to improve my skills.

I’m currently seeking internships as a Software Developer, Application Engineer, or Backend Developer. I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute to a dynamic team and continue growing as a developer.

<!-- What I'm Into
------------
When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me diving into one of the following

* Projects: Always exploring new ideas and tackling interesting challenges.
* Reading: I have a passion for tech books, novels and occasionally philosophy.
* Neovim & Arch Linux: If I' m not doing the above, I might be lost in the depths of configuring my Arch Linux and Neovim setup.

What I Do Best
--------------

* Backend Development: I've invested considerable time mastering backend technologies, but there's always more to learn and explore.
* Computer Science: I've recently delved into some hardcore CS topics and plan to create some innovative projects of my own.

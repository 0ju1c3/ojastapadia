What I'm Into
------------
When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me diving into one of the following

* Projects: Always exploring new ideas and tackling interesting challenges.
* Reading: I have a passion for tech books, novels and occasionally philosophy.
* Neovim & Arch Linux: If I' m not doing the above, I might be lost in the depths of configuring my Arch Linux and Neovim setup.

What I Do Best
--------------

* Backend Development: I've invested considerable time mastering backend technologies, but there's always more to learn and explore.
* Computer Science: I've recently delved into some hardcore CS topics and plan to create some innovative projects of my own.

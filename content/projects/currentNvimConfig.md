My current neovim config using [kickstart.nvim][1] and [lazy.nvim plugin manager][2] can be found [here][3].

* kickstart.nvim comes preconfigured with every important plugin that is required to make neovim into a fully-functioning-better-than-vscode(in my opinion) ide
* lazy.nvim is a super cool package manager with lazy loading

PS: shoutout to Tj Devries and folke

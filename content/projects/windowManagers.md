## Hyprland

Hyprland is a dynamic and modern Wayland compositor for Linux, specifically designed to offer flexibility, customization, and performance. As part of the new wave of Wayland compositors, it is built from the ground up with a focus on modern standards and advanced features, setting it apart from older X11-based window managers.

In my opinion, Hyprland is the best tiling window manager available today and has quickly become my favorite. If you're interested, you can check out my personal configuration [here][1].

That said, it's worth noting that Hyprland is officially available on only a few Linux distributions, which might be a limitation for some users.

### Waybar

Hyprland paired with waybar has completed my search for my linux rice and now I can sigh with satisfaction and look back with tears and think of the brain-crunching errors that I faced in search of my ideal setup.

You can find the config [here][2]

## i3

The short while I was using Ubuntu, I tried and tested a number of tiling windows manager, but nothing, I feel, is as good as thePrimeagen liked i3.

Minimal, dark but fun to rice, if paired with polybar, it comes close to my hyprland-waybar config.

You can find the config [here][3]

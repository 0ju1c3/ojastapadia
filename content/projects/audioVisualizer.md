My second project while exploring frontend domain outside of the cliche websites and use of html, css and js.

Implemented using WebAudio API, Canvas API and vanilla html, css and js.

Takes sound from microphone as input, so has its own bit of problems but got to learn about converting sound to numbers and create bars of appropriate length and use case of fast-fourier transforms which was being taught in my class at that time.
